/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow,0,Adversaries may attempt to dump the contents of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to enable offline password cracking.
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow,0,Most modern Linux operating systems use a combination of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to store user account information including password hashes in /etc/shadow.
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow,0,"By default, /etc/shadow is only readable by the root user."
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow,0,"The Linux utility, unshadow, can be used to combine the two files in a format suited for password cracking utilities such as John the Ripper: # /usr/bin/unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > /tmp/crack.password.db"
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol  caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices.
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniffing or Transmitted Data Manipulation.
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,"The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control  address."
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses.
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,"If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address."
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address.
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device.
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,"The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device."
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,"For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner."
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication.
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,"Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache."
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic.
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,"This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol."
ARP Cache Poisoning,1,Cleaver has used custom tools to facilitate ARP cache poisoning.
AS-REP Roasting,2,Adversaries may reveal credentials of accounts that have disabled Kerberos preauthentication by Password Cracking Kerberos messages.
AS-REP Roasting,2,Preauthentication offers protection against offline Password Cracking.
AS-REP Roasting,2,"When enabled, a user requesting access to a resource initiates communication with the Domain Controller  by sending an Authentication Server Request  message with a timestamp that is encrypted with the hash of their password."
AS-REP Roasting,2,"If and only if the DC is able to successfully decrypt the timestamp with the hash of the user’s password, it will then send an Authentication Server Response  message that contains the Ticket Granting Ticket  to the user."
AS-REP Roasting,2,Part of the AS-REP message is signed with the user’s password.
AS-REP Roasting,2,"For each account found without preauthentication, an adversary may send an AS-REQ message without the encrypted timestamp and receive an AS-REP message with TGT data which may be encrypted with an insecure algorithm such as RC4."
AS-REP Roasting,2,The recovered encrypted data may be vulnerable to offline Password Cracking attacks similarly to Kerberoasting and expose plaintext credentials.
AS-REP Roasting,2,"An account registered to a domain, with or without special privileges, can be abused to list all domain accounts that have preauthentication disabled by utilizing Windows tools like PowerShell with an LDAP filter."
AS-REP Roasting,2,"Alternatively, the adversary may send an AS-REQ message for each user."
AS-REP Roasting,2,"If the DC responds without errors, the account does not require preauthentication and the AS-REP message will already contain the encrypted data."
AS-REP Roasting,2,"Cracked hashes may enable Persistence, Privilege Escalation, and Lateral Movement via access to Valid Accounts."

Access Token Manipulation,4,Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.
Access Token Manipulation,4,Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process.
Access Token Manipulation,4,A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.
Access Token Manipulation,4,"When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token."
Access Token Manipulation,4,An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing.
Access Token Manipulation,4,These token can then be applied to an existing process  Token Impersonation/Theft or used to spawn a new process  Create Process with Token.
Access Token Manipulation,4,An adversary must already be in a privileged user context  administrator to steal a token.
Access Token Manipulation,4,"However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level."
Access Token Manipulation,4,An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.
Access Token Manipulation,4,"Any standard user can use the runas command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account."
Access Token Manipulation,4,"There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens."
Access Token Manipulation,4,Duqu examines running system processes for tokens that have specific system privileges.
Access Token Manipulation,4,"If it finds one, it will copy the token and store it for later use."

AppInit DLLs,17,APT39 has used malware to set LoadAppInit_DLLs in the Registry key SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows in order to establish persistence.
AppleScript,18,Adversaries may abuse AppleScript for execution.
AppleScript,18,AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents.
AppleScript,18,These AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or easily scripted with AppleScript.
AppleScript,18,"These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost any open application locally or remotely."
AppleScript,18,"Scripts can be run from the command-line via osascript /path/to/script or osascript -e ""script here""."
AppleScript,18,"Aside from the command line, scripts can be executed in numerous ways including Mail rules, Calendar.app alarms, and Automator workflows."
AppleScript,18,AppleScripts can also be executed as plain text shell scripts by adding #!/usr/bin/osascript to the start of the script file.
AppleScript,18,"AppleScripts do not need to call osascript to execute, however."
AppleScript,18,"They may be executed from within mach-O binaries by using the macOS Native APIs NSAppleScript or OSAScript, both of which execute code independent of the /usr/bin/osascript command line utility."

Application Access Token,19,"Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems."
Application Access Token,19,These tokens are typically stolen from users and used in lieu of login credentials.
Application Access Token,19,Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud-based applications and software-as-a-service .
Application Access Token,19,OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems.
Application Access Token,19,These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform.
Application Access Token,19,"Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user."
Application Access Token,19,"Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application."
Application Access Token,19,"For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a ""refresh"" token enabling background access is awarded."
Application Access Token,19,With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.
Application Access Token,19,Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services.
Application Access Token,19,"For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines."
Application Access Token,19,Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords.
Application Access Token,19,"Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow."
Application Access Token,19,"APT28 has used several malicious applications that abused OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts, including Gmail and Yahoo Mail."

Application Shimming,22,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims.
Application Shimming,22,The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework  was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time.
Application Shimming,22,"For example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications  that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10."
Application Shimming,22,"Within the framework, shims are created to act as a buffer between the program  and the Windows OS."
Application Shimming,22,"When a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database ."
Application Shimming,22,"If so, the shim database uses hooking to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS."
Application Shimming,22,"A list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer  is kept in:
* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb and
* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\installedsdb
Custom databases are stored in:
* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\custom & %WINDIR%\AppPatch\AppPatch64\Custom and
* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\custom
To keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a shim."
Application Shimming,22,"However, certain shims can be used to Bypass User Account Control , inject DLLs into processes , disable Data Execution Prevention  and Structure Exception Handling , and intercept memory addresses ."
Application Shimming,22,"Utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc."

Browser Session Hijacking,47,"A specific example is when an adversary injects software into a browser that allows them to inherit cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificates of a user then use the browser as a way to pivot into an authenticated intranet."
Browser Session Hijacking,47,"Executing browser-based behaviors such as pivoting may require specific process permissions, such as SeDebugPrivilege and/or high-integrity/administrator rights."
Browser Session Hijacking,47,Another example involves pivoting browser traffic from the adversary's browser through the user's browser by setting up a proxy which will redirect web traffic.
Browser Session Hijacking,47,"This does not alter the user's traffic in any way, and the proxy connection can be severed as soon as the browser is closed."
Browser Session Hijacking,47,The adversary assumes the security context of whichever browser process the proxy is injected into.
Browser Session Hijacking,47,Browsers typically create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly.
Browser Session Hijacking,47,"With these permissions, an adversary could potentially browse to any resource on an intranet, such as Sharepoint or webmail, that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has sufficient permissions."

DLL Search Order Hijacking,107,Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.
DLL Search Order Hijacking,107,There are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads.
DLL Search Order Hijacking,107,"Adversaries may plant trojan dynamic-link library files  in a directory that will be searched before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program, causing Windows to load their malicious library when it is called for by the victim program."
DLL Search Order Hijacking,107,"Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks,  by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL."
DLL Search Order Hijacking,107,Often this location is the current working directory of the program.
DLL Search Order Hijacking,107,Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL.
DLL Search Order Hijacking,107,"Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled  may cause a program to load a different DLL."
DLL Search Order Hijacking,107,"If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level."
DLL Search Order Hijacking,107,"In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator to SYSTEM, depending on the program."
DLL Search Order Hijacking,107,Programs that fall victim to path hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace.

Double File Extension,158,Adversaries may abuse a double extension in the filename as a means of masquerading the true file type.
Double File Extension,158,A file name may include a secondary file type extension that may cause only the first extension to be displayed .
Double File Extension,158,"However, the second extension is the true file type that determines how the file is opened and executed."
Double File Extension,158,"The real file extension may be hidden by the operating system in the file browser , as well as in any software configured using or similar to the system’s policies."
Double File Extension,158,Adversaries may abuse double extensions to attempt to conceal dangerous file types of payloads.
Double File Extension,158,A very common usage involves tricking a user into opening what they think is a benign file type but is actually executable code.
Double File Extension,158,Such files often pose as email attachments and allow an adversary to gain Initial Access into a user’s system via Spearphishing Attachment then User Execution.
Double File Extension,158,"For example, an executable file attachment named Evil.txt.exe may display as Evil.txt to a user."
Double File Extension,158,"The user may then view it as a benign text file and open it, inadvertently executing the hidden malware."
Double File Extension,158,"Common file types, such as text files  and image files  are typically used as the first extension to appear benign."
Double File Extension,158,"Executable extensions commonly regarded as dangerous, such as .exe, .lnk, .hta, and .scr, often appear as the second extension and true file type."

Downgrade Attack,159,"For example, PowerShell versions 5+ includes Script Block Logging  which can record executed script content."
Downgrade Attack,159,"However, adversaries may attempt to execute a previous version of PowerShell that does not support SBL with the intent to Impair Defenses while running malicious scripts that may have otherwise been detected."
Downgrade Attack,159,"Adversaries may downgrade and use less-secure versions of various features of a system, such as Command and Scripting Interpreters or even network protocols that can be abused to enable Adversary-in-the-Middle."
Downgrade System Image,160,Adversaries may install an older version of the operating system of a network device to weaken security.
Downgrade System Image,160,"Older operating system versions on network devices often have weaker encryption ciphers and, in general, fewer/less updated defensive features."
Downgrade System Image,160,"On embedded devices, downgrading the version typically only requires replacing the operating system file in storage."
Downgrade System Image,160,"With most embedded devices, this can be achieved by downloading a copy of the desired version of the operating system file and reconfiguring the device to boot from that file on next system restart."
Downgrade System Image,160,The adversary could then restart the device to implement the change immediately or they could wait until the next time the system restarts.
Downgrade System Image,160,Downgrading the system image to an older versions may allow an adversary to evade defenses by enabling behaviors such as Weaken Encryption.
Downgrade System Image,160,"Downgrading of a system image can be done on its own, or it can be used in conjunction with Patch System Image."
Drive-by Compromise,161,Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing.
Drive-by Compromise,161,"With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring Application Access Token."
Drive-by Compromise,161,"Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist, including:
* A legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript, iFrames, and cross-site scripting."
Drive-by Compromise,161,* Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers.
Drive-by Compromise,161,* Built-in web application interfaces are leveraged for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client .
Drive-by Compromise,161,"Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest."
Drive-by Compromise,161,This kind of targeted attack is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.
Drive-by Compromise,161,There are several known examples of this occurring.
Drive-by Compromise,161,"Typical drive-by compromise process:
1."
Drive-by Compromise,161,A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.
Drive-by Compromise,161,2
Drive-by Compromise,161,"Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version."
Drive-by Compromise,161,* The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.
Drive-by Compromise,161,3
Drive-by Compromise,161,"Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser."
Drive-by Compromise,161,4
Drive-by Compromise,161,"If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place."
Drive-by Compromise,161,* In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.
Drive-by Compromise,161,"Unlike Exploit Public-Facing Application, the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website."
Drive-by Compromise,161,This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.
Drive-by Compromise,161,"Adversaries may also use compromised websites to deliver a user to a malicious application designed to Steal Application Access Tokens, like OAuth tokens, to gain access to protected applications and information."

Drive-by Target,162,Adversaries may prepare an operational environment to infect systems that visit a website over the normal course of browsing.
Drive-by Target,162,"Endpoint systems may be compromised through browsing to adversary controlled sites, as in Drive-by Compromise."
Drive-by Target,162,"In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation , but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such as Application Access Token."
Drive-by Target,162,"Prior to Drive-by Compromise, adversaries must stage resources needed to deliver that exploit to users who browse to an adversary controlled site."
Drive-by Target,162,Drive-by content can be staged on adversary controlled infrastructure that has been acquired  or previously compromised .
Drive-by Target,162,"Adversaries may upload or inject malicious web content, such as JavaScript, into websites."
Drive-by Target,162,"This may be done in a number of ways, including inserting malicious script into web pages or other user controllable web content such as forum posts."
Drive-by Target,162,Adversaries may also craft malicious web advertisements and purchase ad space on a website through legitimate ad providers.
Drive-by Target,162,"In addition to staging content to exploit a user's web browser, adversaries may also stage scripting content to profile the user's browser  to ensure it is vulnerable prior to attempting exploitation."
Drive-by Target,162,"Websites compromised by an adversary and used to stage a drive-by may be ones visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest."
Drive-by Target,162,Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains  during acquisition of infrastructure  to help facilitate Drive-by Compromise.

Drive-by Target,162,"Transparent Tribe has set up websites with malicious hyperlinks and iframes to infect targeted victims with Crimson, njRAT, and other malicious tools."
Dylib Hijacking,163,Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library  with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime.
Dylib Hijacking,163,The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths.
Dylib Hijacking,163,"Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with @rpath, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable."
Dylib Hijacking,163,"Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present."
Dylib Hijacking,163,Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.
Dylib Hijacking,163,Adversaries may gain execution by inserting malicious dylibs with the name of the missing dylib in the identified path.
Dylib Hijacking,163,Dylibs are loaded into an application's address space allowing the malicious dylib to inherit the application's privilege level and resources.
Dylib Hijacking,163,"Based on the application, this could result in privilege escalation and uninhibited network access."
Dylib Hijacking,163,This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
Dynamic Data Exchange,164,Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange  to execute arbitrary commands.
Dynamic Data Exchange,164,DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication  between applications.
Dynamic Data Exchange,164,"Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links , hot data links , and requests for command execution."
Dynamic Data Exchange,164,"Object Linking and Embedding , or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE."
Dynamic Data Exchange,164,"Despite being superseded by Component Object Model, DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Office 2016 via Registry keys."
Dynamic Data Exchange,164,"Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands  , directly or through embedded files , and used to deliver execution via Phishing campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications  macros."
Dynamic Data Exchange,164,DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to a Command and Scripting Interpreter.
Dynamic Data Exchange,164,DDE execution can be invoked remotely via Remote Services such as Distributed Component Object Model .

Dynamic Linker Hijacking,165,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries.
Dynamic Linker Hijacking,165,"During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as LD_PRELOAD on Linux or DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES on macOS."
Dynamic Linker Hijacking,165,"Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name."
Dynamic Linker Hijacking,165,"These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library."
Dynamic Linker Hijacking,165,"On Linux and macOS, hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges."
Dynamic Linker Hijacking,165,"Adversaries can set environment variables via the command line using the export command, setenv function, or putenv function."
Dynamic Linker Hijacking,165,Adversaries can also leverage Dynamic Linker Hijacking to export variables in a shell or set variables programmatically using higher level syntax such Python’s os.environ.
Dynamic Linker Hijacking,165,"On Linux, adversaries may set LD_PRELOAD to point to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program."
Dynamic Linker Hijacking,165,LD_PRELOAD can be set via the environment variable or /etc/ld.so.preload file.
Dynamic Linker Hijacking,165,Libraries specified by LD_PRELOAD are loaded and mapped into memory by dlopen and mmap respectively.
Dynamic Linker Hijacking,165,"On macOS this behavior is conceptually the same as on Linux, differing only in how the macOS dynamic libraries  is implemented at a lower level."
Dynamic Linker Hijacking,165,Adversaries can set the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable to point to malicious libraries containing names of legitimate libraries or functions requested by a victim program.

Dynamic-link Library Injection,167,Adversaries may inject dynamic-link libraries  into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
Dynamic-link Library Injection,167,DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
Dynamic-link Library Injection,167,DLL injection is commonly performed by writing the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before loading the DLL by invoking a new thread.
Dynamic-link Library Injection,167,"The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory, then invoked with CreateRemoteThread ."
Dynamic-link Library Injection,167,Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection  and memory module  overcome the address relocation issue as well as the additional APIs to invoke execution .

Endpoint Denial of Service,178,Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service.
Endpoint Denial of Service,178,"These layers include the Operating Systems , server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the  applications that sit on top of them."
Endpoint Denial of Service,178,Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components.
Endpoint Denial of Service,178,"A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS ."
Endpoint Denial of Service,178,"To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets."
Endpoint Denial of Service,178,"Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection."
Endpoint Denial of Service,178,This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.
Endpoint Denial of Service,178,Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services.
Endpoint Denial of Service,178,Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet.
Endpoint Denial of Service,178,"In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources."
Endpoint Denial of Service,178,"Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks."
Endpoint Denial of Service,178,"In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the the global network  where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume."
Endpoint Denial of Service,178,This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.

Environmental Keying,179,Adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment.
Environmental Keying,179,Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.
Environmental Keying,179,Environmental keying is an implementation of Execution Guardrails that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.
Environmental Keying,179,Values can be derived from target-specific elements and used to generate a decryption key for an encrypted payload.
Environmental Keying,179,"Target-specific values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses."
Environmental Keying,179,"By generating the decryption keys from target-specific environmental values, environmental keying can make sandbox detection, anti-virus detection, crowdsourcing of information, and reverse engineering difficult."
Environmental Keying,179,"These difficulties can slow down the incident response process and help adversaries hide their tactics, techniques, and procedures ."
Environmental Keying,179,"Similar to Obfuscated Files or Information, adversaries may use environmental keying to help protect their TTPs and evade detection."
Environmental Keying,179,Environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted payload to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the payload before execution.
Environmental Keying,179,By utilizing target-specific values to decrypt the payload the adversary can avoid packaging the decryption key with the payload or sending it over a potentially monitored network connection.
Environmental Keying,179,"Depending on the technique for gathering target-specific values, reverse engineering of the encrypted payload can be exceptionally difficult."
Environmental Keying,179,This can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.
Environmental Keying,179,"Like other Execution Guardrails, environmental keying can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within."
Environmental Keying,179,This activity is distinct from typical Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.
Environmental Keying,179,"While use of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of environmental keying will involve checking for an expected target-specific value that must match for decryption and subsequent execution to be successful."
Environmental Keying,179,"InvisiMole can use Data Protection API to encrypt its components on the victim’s computer, to evade detection, and to make sure the payload can only be decrypted and loaded on one specific compromised computer."
Environmental Keying,179,Equation has been observed utilizing environmental keying in payload delivery.
Environmental Keying,179,"APT41 has encrypted payloads using the Data Protection API , which relies on keys tied to specific user accounts on specific machines."
Environmental Keying,179,APT41 has also environmentally keyed second stage malware with an RC5 key derived in part from the infected system's volume serial number.
Escape to Host,180,Adversaries may break out of a container to gain access to the underlying host.
Escape to Host,180,This can allow an adversary access to other containerized resources from the host level or to the host itself.
Escape to Host,180,"In principle, containerized resources should provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from the host environment."
Escape to Host,180,There are multiple ways an adversary may escape to a host environment.
Escape to Host,180,"Examples include creating a container configured to mount the host’s filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host, or utilizing a privileged container to run commands on the underlying host."
Escape to Host,180,"Adversaries may also escape via Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in global symbolic links in order to access the root directory of a host machine."
Escape to Host,180,"Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host."

Establish Accounts,181,"This development could be applied to social media, website, or other publicly available information that could be referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy over the course of an operation using that persona or identity."
Establish Accounts,181,These personas may be fictitious or impersonate real people.
Establish Accounts,181,The persona may exist on a single site or across multiple sites .
Establish Accounts,181,Establishing a persona may require development of additional documentation to make them seem real.
Establish Accounts,181,"This could include filling out profile information, developing social networks, or incorporating photos."
Establish Accounts,181,"Establishing accounts can also include the creation of accounts with email providers, which may be directly leveraged for Phishing for Information or Phishing."

Establish Accounts,181,"To make profile pages appear more legitimate, APT17 has created biographical sections and posted in forum threads."
Establish Accounts,181,Fox Kitten has created KeyBase accounts to communicate with ransomware victims.
Event Triggered Execution,182,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events.
Event Triggered Execution,182,Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries.
Event Triggered Execution,182,Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via repeatedly executing malicious code.
Event Triggered Execution,182,"After gaining access to a victim system, adversaries may create/modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked."
Event Triggered Execution,182,"Since the execution can be proxied by an account with higher permissions, such as SYSTEM or service accounts, an adversary may be able to abuse these triggered execution mechanisms to escalate their privileges."
Exchange Email Delegate Permissions,183,"Adversaries may grant additional permission levels, such as ReadPermission or FullAccess, to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account."
Exchange Email Delegate Permissions,183,"The Add-MailboxPermission PowerShell cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Office 365, adds permissions to a mailbox."
Exchange Email Delegate Permissions,183,Adversaries may also assign mailbox folder permissions through individual folder permissions or roles.
Exchange Email Delegate Permissions,183,"Adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store , Inbox, or other mailbox folders."
Exchange Email Delegate Permissions,183,"By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder, the adversary can utilize any other account in the tenant to maintain persistence to the target user’s mail folders."
Exchange Email Delegate Permissions,183,This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC  incidents where an adversary can assign more access rights to the accounts they wish to compromise.
Exchange Email Delegate Permissions,183,This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems.
Exchange Email Delegate Permissions,183,"For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target business while creating inbox rules , so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms."
Exchange Email Delegate Permissions,183,"UNC2452 added their own devices as allowed IDs for active sync using Set-CASMailbox, allowing it to obtain copies of victim mailboxes."
Exchange Email Delegate Permissions,183,It also added additional permissions  to compromised Application or Service Principals.
Exchange Email Delegate Permissions,183,"APT29 added their own devices as allowed IDs for active sync using Set-CASMailbox, allowing it to obtain copies of victim mailboxes."
Exchange Email Delegate Permissions,183,APT28 has used a Powershell cmdlet to grant the ApplicationImpersonation role to a compromised account.
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer.
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions.
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,"If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process."
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,"If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM."
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,"Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers."
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,"During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the %TEMP% directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads."
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,"When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process."
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,This behavior is related to and may take advantage of DLL Search Order Hijacking.
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level.
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code.
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,This behavior is related to Bypass User Account Control.
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors.
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,184,If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event  then this technique can also be used for persistence.
Execution Guardrails,185,Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.
Execution Guardrails,185,Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign.
Execution Guardrails,185,"Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory  domains, and local/external IP addresses."
Execution Guardrails,185,Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.
Execution Guardrails,185,This use of guardrails is distinct from typical Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.
Execution Guardrails,185,"While use of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match."
Execution Guardrails,185,Anchor can terminate itself if specific execution flags are not present.
Execution Guardrails,185,SUNSPOT only replaces SolarWinds Orion source code if the MD5 checksums of both the original source code file and backdoored replacement source code match hardcoded values.

Extra Window Memory Injection,208,Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window Memory  in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
Extra Window Memory Injection,208,EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
Extra Window Memory Injection,208,"Before creating a window, graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows class, which stipulate appearance and behavior ."
Extra Window Memory Injection,208,Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up to 40 bytes of EWM to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance of that class.
Extra Window Memory Injection,208,This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window and has specific application programming interface  functions to set and get its value.
Extra Window Memory Injection,208,"Although small, the EWM is large enough to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure."
Extra Window Memory Injection,208,"Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process’s EWM."
Extra Window Memory Injection,208,Execution granted through EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges.
Extra Window Memory Injection,208,Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread.
Extra Window Memory Injection,208,More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention  by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.
Extra Window Memory Injection,208,Execution via EWM injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
Extra Window Memory Injection,208,Power Loader overwrites Explorer’s Shell_TrayWnd extra window memory to redirect execution to a NTDLL function that is abused to assemble and execute a return-oriented programming  chain and create a malicious thread within Explorer.exe.

Firmware,215,"Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance  or Search Open Technical Databases, establishing operational resources  or Obtain Capabilities, and/or initial access  or Exploit Public-Facing Application."
Firmware Corruption,216,Adversaries may overwrite or corrupt the flash memory contents of system BIOS or other firmware in devices attached to a system in order to render them inoperable or unable to boot.
Firmware Corruption,216,Firmware is software that is loaded and executed from non-volatile memory on hardware devices in order to initialize and manage device functionality.

Forced Authentication,217,Adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing a user to automatically provide authentication information through a mechanism in which they can intercept.
Forced Authentication,217,The Server Message Block  protocol is commonly used in Windows networks for authentication and communication between systems for access to resources and file sharing.
Forced Authentication,217,When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information for the current user to the remote system.
Forced Authentication,217,This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so that users do not need to enter credentials to access network resources.
Forced Authentication,217,Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning  is also typically used by Windows systems as a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails.
Forced Authentication,217,WebDAV is an extension of HTTP and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443.
Forced Authentication,217,Adversaries may take advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account hashes through forced SMB/WebDAV authentication.
Forced Authentication,217,"An adversary can send an attachment to a user through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external server controlled by the adversary  Template Injection, or place a specially crafted file on navigation path for privileged accounts  or on a publicly accessible share to be accessed by victim."
Forced Authentication,217,"When the user's system accesses the untrusted resource it will attempt authentication and send information, including the user's hashed credentials, over SMB to the adversary controlled server."
Forced Authentication,217,"With access to the credential hash, an adversary can perform off-line Brute Force cracking to gain access to plaintext credentials."
Forced Authentication,217,There are several different ways this can occur.
Forced Authentication,217,"Some specifics from in-the-wild use include:
* A spearphishing attachment containing a document with a resource that is automatically loaded when the document is opened  Template Injection."
Forced Authentication,217,"The document can include, for example, a request similar to file://remote address/Normal.dotm to trigger the SMB request."
Forced Authentication,217,* A modified .LNK or .SCF file with the icon filename pointing to an external reference such as \\remote address\pic.png that will force the system to load the resource when the icon is rendered to repeatedly gather credentials.
Forced Authentication,217,EnvyScout can use protocol handlers to coax the operating system to send NTLMv2 authentication responses to attacker-controlled infrastructure.
Forced Authentication,217,DarkHydrus used Template Injection to launch an authentication window for users to enter their credentials.
Forced Authentication,217,Dragonfly 2.0 has gathered hashed user credentials over SMB using spearphishing attachments with external resource links and by modifying .LNK file icon resources to collect credentials from virtualized systems.
Forced Authentication,217,Dragonfly has performed forced authentication to gather hashed user credentials over SMB using spearphishing attachments with external resource links and by modifying .LNK file icon resources to collect credentials from virtualized systems.
Forge Web Credentials,218,Adversaries may forge credential materials that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services.
Forge Web Credentials,218,"Web applications and services  often use session cookies, tokens, or other materials to authenticate and authorize user access."
Forge Web Credentials,218,Adversaries may generate these credential materials in order to gain access to web resources.
Forge Web Credentials,218,"This differs from Steal Web Session Cookie, Steal Application Access Token, and other similar behaviors in that the credentials are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users."
Forge Web Credentials,218,"The generation of web credentials often requires secret values, such as passwords, Private Keys, or other cryptographic seed values."

Indicator Blocking,246,These settings may be stored on the system in configuration files and/or in the Registry as well as being accessible via administrative utilities such as PowerShell or Windows Management Instrumentation.
Indicator Blocking,246,"ETW interruption can be achieved multiple ways, however most directly by defining conditions using the PowerShell Set-EtwTraceProvider cmdlet or by interfacing directly with the Registry to make alterations."
Indicator Blocking,246,"In the case of network-based reporting of indicators, an adversary may block traffic associated with reporting to prevent central analysis."
Indicator Blocking,246,"This may be accomplished by many means, such as stopping a local process responsible for forwarding telemetry and/or creating a host-based firewall rule to block traffic to specific hosts responsible for aggregating events, such as security information and event management  products."
Indicator Blocking,246,Ebury can hook logging functions so that nothing from the backdoor gets sent to the logging facility.
Indicator Blocking,246,Waterbear can hook the ZwOpenProcess and GetExtendedTcpTable APIs called by the process of a security product to hide PIDs and TCP records from detection.

Install Digital Certificate,253,"Installation of digital certificates may take place for a number of server types, including web servers and email servers."
Install Digital Certificate,253,Adversaries can obtain digital certificates  or create self-signed certificates .
Install Digital Certificate,253,Digital certificates can then be installed on adversary controlled infrastructure that may have been acquired  or previously compromised .
Install Root Certificate,254,Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary controlled web servers.
Install Root Certificate,254,Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority .
Install Root Certificate,254,"When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate."
Install Root Certificate,254,Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser.
Install Root Certificate,254,When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk.
Install Root Certificate,254,"Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website."
Install Root Certificate,254,Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system.
Install Root Certificate,254,Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials.
Install Root Certificate,254,Atypical root certificates have also been pre-installed on systems by the manufacturer or in the software supply chain and were used in conjunction with malware/adware to provide Adversary-in-the-Middle capability for intercepting information transmitted over secure TLS/SSL communications.
Install Root Certificate,254,Root certificates  can also be cloned and reinstalled.
Install Root Certificate,254,Cloned certificate chains will carry many of the same metadata characteristics of the source and can be used to sign malicious code that may then bypass signature validation tools  used to block execution and/or uncover artifacts of Persistence.
Install Root Certificate,254,"In macOS, the Ay MaMi malware uses /usr/bin/security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/malicious/cert to install a malicious certificate as a trusted root certificate into the system keychain."
Install Root Certificate,254,Dok installs a root certificate to aid in Adversary-in-the-Middle actions using the command add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /tmp/filename.
Install Root Certificate,254,RTM can add a certificate to the Windows store.
Install Root Certificate,254,Hikit uses certmgr.exe -add GlobalSign.cer -c -s -r localMachine Root and certmgr.exe -add GlobalSign.cer -c -s -r localMachineTrustedPublisher to install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher.
InstallUtil,255,Adversaries may use InstallUtil to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility.
InstallUtil,255,InstallUtil is a command-line utility that allows for installation and uninstallation of resources by executing specific installer components specified in .NET binaries.
InstallUtil,255,InstallUtil is digitally signed by Microsoft and located in the .NET directories on a Windows system: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe and C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v<version>\InstallUtil.exe.
InstallUtil,255,InstallUtil may also be used to bypass application control through use of attributes within the binary that execute the class decorated with the attribute System.ComponentModel.RunInstaller.

Inter-Process Communication,256,"IPC is typically used by processes to share data, communicate with each other, or synchronize execution."
Inter-Process Communication,256,"IPC is also commonly used to avoid situations such as deadlocks, which occurs when processes are stuck in a cyclic waiting pattern."
Inter-Process Communication,256,Adversaries may abuse IPC to execute arbitrary code or commands.
Inter-Process Communication,256,"IPC mechanisms may differ depending on OS, but typically exists in a form accessible through programming languages/libraries or native interfaces such as Windows Dynamic Data Exchange or Component Object Model."
Inter-Process Communication,256,"Higher level execution mediums, such as those of Command and Scripting Interpreters, may also leverage underlying IPC mechanisms."
Inter-Process Communication,256,Adversaries may also use Remote Services such as Distributed Component Object Model to facilitate remote IPC execution.
Inter-Process Communication,256,HyperStack can connect to the IPC$ share on remote machines.
Internal Defacement,257,An adversary may deface systems internal to an organization in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users.
Internal Defacement,257,"This may take the form of modifications to internal websites, or directly to user systems with the replacement of the desktop wallpaper."
Internal Defacement,257,"Disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of Internal Defacement in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure compliance with accompanying messages."
Internal Defacement,257,"Since internally defacing systems exposes an adversary's presence, it often takes place after other intrusion goals have been accomplished."
Internal Defacement,257,Lazarus Group replaced the background wallpaper of systems with a threatening image after rendering the system unbootable with a Disk Structure Wipe
Internal Proxy,258,Adversaries may use an internal proxy to direct command and control traffic between two or more systems in a compromised environment.
Internal Proxy,258,"Adversaries use internal proxies to manage command and control communications inside a compromised environment, to reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between infected systems to avoid suspicion."
Internal Proxy,258,"Internal proxy connections may use common peer-to-peer  networking protocols, such as SMB, to better blend in with the environment."
Internal Proxy,258,"By using a compromised internal system as a proxy, adversaries may conceal the true destination of C2 traffic while reducing the need for numerous connections to external systems."
Internal Proxy,258,Hikit supports peer connections.

Multi-hop Proxy,307,"To disguise the source of malicious traffic, adversaries may chain together multiple proxies."
Multi-hop Proxy,307,"Typically, a defender will be able to identify the last proxy traffic traversed before it enters their network; the defender may or may not be able to identify any previous proxies before the last-hop proxy."
Multi-hop Proxy,307,This technique makes identifying the original source of the malicious traffic even more difficult by requiring the defender to trace malicious traffic through several proxies to identify its source.
Multi-hop Proxy,307,"A particular variant of this behavior is to use onion routing networks, such as the publicly available TOR network."
Multi-hop Proxy,307,"In the case of network infrastructure, particularly routers, it is possible for an adversary to leverage multiple compromised devices to create a multi-hop proxy chain within the Wide-Area Network  of the enterprise."

Network Address Translation Traversal,312,Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by modifying a network device’s Network Address Translation  configuration.
Network Address Translation Traversal,312,Malicious modifications to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.
Network Address Translation Traversal,312,Network devices such as routers and firewalls that connect multiple networks together may implement NAT during the process of passing packets between networks.
Network Address Translation Traversal,312,"When performing NAT, the network device will rewrite the source and/or destination addresses of the IP address header."
Network Address Translation Traversal,312,Some network designs require NAT for the packets to cross the border device.
Network Address Translation Traversal,312,A typical example of this is environments where internal networks make use of non-Internet routable addresses.
Network Address Translation Traversal,312,"When an adversary gains control of a network boundary device, they can either leverage existing NAT configurations to send traffic between two separated networks, or they can implement NAT configurations of their own design."
Network Address Translation Traversal,312,"In the case of network designs that require NAT to function, this enables the adversary to overcome inherent routing limitations that would normally prevent them from accessing protected systems behind the border device."
Network Address Translation Traversal,312,"In the case of network designs that do not require NAT, address translation can be used by adversaries to obscure their activities, as changing the addresses of packets that traverse a network boundary device can make monitoring data transmissions more challenging for defenders."
Network Address Translation Traversal,312,"Adversaries may use Patch System Image to change the operating system of a network device, implementing their own custom NAT mechanisms to further obscure their activities"
Network Boundary Bridging,313,Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices.
Network Boundary Bridging,313,Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.
Network Boundary Bridging,313,Devices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks.
Network Boundary Bridging,313,They achieve this by restricting traffic types to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in such connections.
Network Boundary Bridging,313,"Restriction of traffic can be achieved by prohibiting IP addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection to identify applications."
Network Boundary Bridging,313,"To participate with the rest of the network, these devices can be directly addressable or transparent, but their mode of operation has no bearing on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised."
Network Boundary Bridging,313,"When an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary between the two separated networks without hinderance."
Network Boundary Bridging,313,"By achieving sufficient rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic they want, allowing them to then further achieve goals such as command and control via Multi-hop Proxy or exfiltration of data via Traffic Duplication."
Network Boundary Bridging,313,"In the cases where a border device separates two separate organizations, the adversary can also facilitate lateral movement into new victim environments."
Network Denial of Service,314,Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service  attacks to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users.
Network Denial of Service,314,Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on.
Network Denial of Service,314,"Example resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications."
Network Denial of Service,314,"Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion."
Network Denial of Service,314,A Network DoS will occur when the bandwidth capacity of the network connection to a system is exhausted due to the volume of malicious traffic directed at the resource or the network connections and network devices the resource relies on.
Network Denial of Service,314,"For example, an adversary may send 10Gbps of traffic to a server that is hosted by a network with a 1Gbps connection to the internet."
Network Denial of Service,314,"This traffic can be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS ."
Network Denial of Service,314,"To perform Network DoS attacks several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing, and botnets."
Network Denial of Service,314,"For DoS attacks targeting the hosting system directly, see Endpoint Denial of Service."
Network Denial of Service,314,"Lucifer can execute TCP, UDP,  and HTTP denial of service  attacks."
Network Denial of Service,314,"In 2016, APT28 conducted a distributed denial of service  attack against the World Anti-Doping Agency."
Network Device Authentication,315,"Adversaries may use Patch System Image to hard code a password in the operating system, thus bypassing of native authentication mechanisms for local accounts on network devices."
Network Device Authentication,315,Modify System Image may include implanted code to the operating system for network devices to provide access for adversaries using a specific password.
Network Device Authentication,315,The modification includes a specific password which is implanted in the operating system image via the patch.
Network Device Authentication,315,"Upon authentication attempts, the inserted code will first check to see if the user input is the password."
Network Device Authentication,315,"If so, access is granted."
Network Device Authentication,315,"Otherwise, the implanted code will pass the credentials on for verification of potentially valid credentials."
Network Device Authentication,315,SYNful Knock has the capability to add its own custom backdoor password when it modifies the operating system of the affected network device.
Network Device CLI,316,Adversaries may abuse scripting or built-in command line interpreters  on network devices to execute malicious command and payloads.
Network Device CLI,316,"The CLI is the primary means through which users and administrators interact with the device in order to view system information, modify device operations, or perform diagnostic and administrative functions."
Network Device CLI,316,CLIs typically contain various permission levels required for different commands.
Network Device CLI,316,Scripting interpreters automate tasks and extend functionality beyond the command set included in the network OS.
Network Device CLI,316,"The CLI and scripting interpreter are accessible through a direct console connection, or through remote means, such as telnet or SSH."

Patch System Image,350,"By modifying the instructions stored in the system image file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities that the device did not have before."
Patch System Image,350,"Examples of existing defenses that can be impeded include encryption, via Weaken Encryption, authentication, via Network Device Authentication, and perimeter defenses, via Network Boundary Bridging."
Patch System Image,350,"Adding new capabilities for the adversary’s purpose include Keylogging, Multi-hop Proxy, and Port Knocking."
Patch System Image,350,Adversaries may also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false output to mislead defenders.
Patch System Image,350,"When this method is used in conjunction with Downgrade System Image, one example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system."

Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,351,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables used to load libraries.
Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,351,"Adversaries may place a program in an earlier entry in the list of directories stored in the PATH environment variable, which Windows will then execute when it searches sequentially through that PATH listing in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command line."
Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,351,The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories.
Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,351,Certain methods of executing a program  rely solely on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched for a program when the path for the program is not given.
Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,351,"If any directories are listed in the PATH environment variable before the Windows directory, %SystemRoot%\system32 , a program may be placed in the preceding directory that is named the same as a Windows program , which will be executed when that command is executed from a script or command-line."
Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,351,"For example, if C:\example path precedes C:\Windows\system32 is in the PATH environment variable, a program that is named net.exe and placed in C:\example path will be called instead of the Windows system ""net"" when ""net"" is executed from the command-line."
Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,352,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs.
Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,352,"Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program."
Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,352,Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path.
Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,352,"Unlike DLL Search Order Hijacking, the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program."
Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,352,"However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory."
Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,352,"An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking , a program that does not specify the path to an executable may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory."
Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,352,"For example, ""example.exe"" runs ""cmd.exe"" with the command-line argument net user."
Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,352,"An adversary may place a program called ""net.exe"" within the same directory as example.exe, ""net.exe"" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net."
Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,352,"In addition, if an adversary places a program called ""net.com"" in the same directory as ""net.exe"", then cmd.exe /C net user will execute ""net.com"" instead of ""net.exe"" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT."
Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,352,Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in DLL Search Order Hijacking.
Path Interception by Unquoted Path,353,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references.
Path Interception by Unquoted Path,353,"Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch."
Path Interception by Unquoted Path,353,Service paths  and shortcut paths may also be vulnerable to path interception if the path has one or more spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks .
Path Interception by Unquoted Path,353,"An adversary can place an executable in a higher level directory of the path, and Windows will resolve that executable instead of the intended executable."
Path Interception by Unquoted Path,353,"For example, if the path in a shortcut is C:\program files\myapp.exe, an adversary may create a program at C:\program.exe that will be run instead of the intended program."
Path Interception by Unquoted Path,353,"This technique can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process."

Print Processors,366,"Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, during boot."
Print Processors,366,Adversaries may abuse the print spooler service by adding print processors that load malicious DLLs at startup.
Print Processors,366,A print processor can be installed through the AddPrintProcessor API call with an account that has SeLoadDriverPrivilege enabled.
Print Processors,366,"Alternatively, a print processor can be registered to the print spooler service by adding the HKLM\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet or ControlSet001\Control\Print\Environments\\Windows architecture: e.g., Windows x64\Print Processors\\user defined\Driver Registry key that points to the DLL."
Print Processors,366,"For the print processor to be correctly installed, it must be located in the system print-processor directory that can be found with the GetPrintProcessorDirectory API call."
Print Processors,366,"After the print processors are installed, the print spooler service, which starts during boot, must be restarted in order for them to run."
Print Processors,366,"The print spooler service runs under SYSTEM level permissions, therefore print processors installed by an adversary may run under elevated privileges."
Print Processors,366,The PipeMon installer has modified the Registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows x64\Print Processors to install PipeMon as a Print Processor.

Proc Filesystem,368,Adversaries may gather credentials from information stored in the Proc filesystem or /proc.
Proc Filesystem,368,The Proc filesystem on Linux contains a great deal of information regarding the state of the running operating system.
Proc Filesystem,368,Processes running with root privileges can use this facility to scrape live memory of other running programs.
Proc Filesystem,368,"If any of these programs store passwords in clear text or password hashes in memory, these values can then be harvested for either usage or brute force attacks, respectively."
Proc Filesystem,368,"This functionality has been implemented in the MimiPenguin, an open source tool inspired by Mimikatz."
Proc Filesystem,368,"The tool dumps process memory, then harvests passwords and hashes by looking for text strings and regex patterns for how given applications such as Gnome Keyring, sshd, and Apache use memory to store such authentication artifacts."
Proc Memory,369,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the /proc filesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
Proc Memory,369,Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
Proc Memory,369,Proc memory injection involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc filesystem  then crafting a return-oriented programming  payload with available gadgets/instructions.
Proc Memory,369,"Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory mappings."
Proc Memory,369,Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’ stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem.
Proc Memory,369,This information can be used to enumerate offsets  and gadgets  otherwise hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization .
Proc Memory,369,"Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within /proc/pid/maps can be overwritten using dd."
Proc Memory,369,Other techniques such as Dynamic Linker Hijacking may be used to populate a target process with more available gadgets.
Proc Memory,369,"Similar to Process Hollowing, proc memory injection may target child processes ."
Proc Memory,369,Execution via proc memory injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

Process Doppelgänging,371,Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via process doppelgänging in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
Process Doppelgänging,371,Process doppelgänging is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
Process Doppelgänging,371,Windows Transactional NTFS  was introduced in Vista as a method to perform safe file operations.
Process Doppelgänging,371,"To ensure data integrity, TxF enables only one transacted handle to write to a file at a given time."
Process Doppelgänging,371,"Until the write handle transaction is terminated, all other handles are isolated from the writer and may only read the committed version of the file that existed at the time the handle was opened."
Process Doppelgänging,371,"To avoid corruption, TxF performs an automatic rollback if the system or application fails during a write transaction."
Process Doppelgänging,371,"Although deprecated, the TxF application programming interface  is still enabled as of Windows 10."
Process Doppelgänging,371,Adversaries may abuse TxF to a perform a file-less variation of Process Injection.

Process Doppelgänging,371,"Process doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored API functions such as NtUnmapViewOfSection, VirtualProtectEx, and SetThreadContext."
Process Doppelgänging,371,"Process Doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps :
* Transact – Create a TxF transaction using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with malicious code."
Process Doppelgänging,371,These changes will be isolated and only visible within the context of the transaction.
Process Doppelgänging,371,* Load – Create a shared section of memory and load the malicious executable.
Process Doppelgänging,371,"* Rollback – Undo changes to original executable, effectively removing malicious code from the file system."
Process Doppelgänging,371,* Animate – Create a process from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.
Process Doppelgänging,371,This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from  of the injecting process.

Process Hollowing,372,"A victim process can be created with native Windows API calls such as CreateProcess, which includes a flag to suspend the processes primary thread."
Process Hollowing,372,"At this point the process can be unmapped using APIs calls such as ZwUnmapViewOfSection or NtUnmapViewOfSection  before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, SetThreadContext, then ResumeThread respectively."
Process Hollowing,372,This is very similar to Thread Local Storage but creates a new process rather than targeting an existing process.
Process Hollowing,372,"However, execution via process hollowing may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process."

RDP Hijacking,383,It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system.
RDP Hijacking,383,Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol  as Remote Desktop Services .
RDP Hijacking,383,Adversaries may perform RDP session hijacking which involves stealing a legitimate user's remote session.
RDP Hijacking,383,"Typically, a user is notified when someone else is trying to steal their session."
RDP Hijacking,383,"With System permissions and using Terminal Services Console, `c:\windows\system32\tscon.exe session number to be stolen`, an adversary can hijack a session without the need for credentials or prompts to the user."
RDP Hijacking,383,This can be done remotely or locally and with active or disconnected sessions.
RDP Hijacking,383,It can also lead to Remote System Discovery and Privilege Escalation by stealing a Domain Admin or higher privileged account session.

Re-opened Applications,385,Adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in.
Re-opened Applications,385,"Starting in Mac OS X 10.7 , users can specify certain applications to be re-opened when a user logs into their machine after reboot."
Re-opened Applications,385,"While this is usually done via a Graphical User Interface  on an app-by-app basis, there are property list files  that contain this information as well located at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist and ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow."
Re-opened Applications,385,* .plist.
Re-opened Applications,385,An adversary can modify one of these files directly to include a link to their malicious executable to provide a persistence mechanism each time the user reboots their machine .
Reduce Key Space,386,Adversaries may reduce the level of effort required to decrypt data transmitted over the network by reducing the cipher strength of encrypted communications.

Reduce Key Space,386,"As a result, adversaries dramatically reduce the amount of effort needed to decrypt the protected information without the key."
Reduce Key Space,386,Adversaries may modify the key size used and other encryption parameters using specialized commands in a Network Device CLI introduced to the system through Modify System Image to change the configuration of the device.
Reflection Amplification,387,Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target.
Reflection Amplification,387,This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address.
Reflection Amplification,387,This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector.
Reflection Amplification,387,An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim.
Reflection Amplification,387,"Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used."
Reflection Amplification,387,"Likewise, one or more reflector may be used to focus traffic on the target."
Reflection Amplification,387,"Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack."
Reflection Amplification,387,Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers.
Reflection Amplification,387,"The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume."
Reflection Amplification,387,"Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS and NTP, though the use of several others in the wild have been documented."
Reflection Amplification,387,"In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet."
Reflective Code Loading,388,Adversaries may reflectively load code into a process in order to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
Reflective Code Loading,388,"Reflective loading involves allocating then executing payloads directly within the memory of the process, vice creating a thread or process backed by a file path on disk."
Reflective Code Loading,388,"Reflectively loaded payloads may be compiled binaries, anonymous files , or just snubs of fileless executable code ."
Reflective Code Loading,388,Reflective code injection is very similar to Process Injection except that the “injection” loads code into the processes’ own memory instead of that of a separate process.
Reflective Code Loading,388,Reflective loading may evade process-based detections since the execution of the arbitrary code may be masked within a legitimate or otherwise benign process.
Reflective Code Loading,388,"Reflectively loading payloads directly into memory may also avoid creating files or other artifacts on disk, while also enabling malware to keep these payloads encrypted  until execution."
Reflective Code Loading,388,Lokibot has reflectively loaded the decoded DLL into memory.
Reflective Code Loading,388,Cobalt Strike's execute-assembly command can run a .NET executable within the memory of a sacrificial process by loading the CLR.
Reflective Code Loading,388,ThiefQuest uses various API functions such as NSCreateObjectFileImageFromMemory to load and link in-memory payloads.

Setuid and Setgid,443,"On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively. ."
Setuid and Setgid,443,"Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application."
Setuid and Setgid,443,"However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them doesn’t need the elevated privileges."
Setuid and Setgid,443,"Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications."
Setuid and Setgid,443,"These bits are indicated with an ""s"" instead of an ""x"" when viewing a file's attributes via ls -l. The chmod program can set these bits with via bitmasking, chmod 4777 file or via shorthand naming, chmod u+s file."
Setuid and Setgid,443,Adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.. Keydnap adds the setuid flag to a binary so it can easily elevate in the future.
Setuid and Setgid,443,Exaramel for Linux can execute commands with high privileges via a specific binary with setuid functionality.

Stored Data Manipulation,468,"APT38 has used DYEPACK to create, delete, and alter records in databases used for SWIFT transactions."
Subvert Trust Controls,469,Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted programs.
Subvert Trust Controls,469,Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs or websites as possessing some level of trust.
Subvert Trust Controls,469,"Examples of such features would include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate, a program prompting the user with a warning because it has an attribute set from being downloaded from the Internet, or getting an indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site."
Subvert Trust Controls,469,Adversaries may attempt to subvert these trust mechanisms.

Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the suoders file to elevate privileges.
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo  allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"The sudo command ""allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users  the ability to run some  commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments."""
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a timestamp_timeout, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of sudo before it will re-prompt for a password."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,This is because sudo has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time.
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,Sudo creates  a file at /var/db/sudo with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout.
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"Additionally, there is a tty_tickets variable that treats each new tty  in isolation."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty ."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"The sudoers file, /etc/sudoers, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups.
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like user1 ALL= NOPASSWD: ALL ."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password.
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"For example, /var/db/sudo's timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the timestamp_timeout range."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"Additional, if tty_tickets is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"In the wild, malware has disabled tty_tickets to potentially make scripting easier by issuing echo \'Defaults !tty_tickets\' >> /etc/sudoers ."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"In order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issued killall Terminal."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,"As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers file has tty_tickets enabled by default."
Sudo and Sudo Caching,470,Proton modifies the tty_tickets line in the sudoers file.

* Manipulation of source code in open-source dependencies
* Manipulation of software update/distribution mechanisms
* Compromised/infected system images    
* Replacement of legitimate software with modified versions
* Sales of modified/counterfeit products to legitimate distributors
* Shipment interdiction
While supply chain compromise can impact any component of hardware or software, attackers looking to gain execution have often focused on malicious additions to legitimate software in software distribution or update channels."
Supply Chain Compromise,471,Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set  or malicious software may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.
Supply Chain Compromise,471,Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may also be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency.

Systemd Service,485,Adversaries may create or modify systemd services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence.
Systemd Service,485,The systemd service manager is commonly used for managing background daemon processes  and other system resources.
Systemd Service,485,"Systemd is the default initialization  system on many Linux distributions starting with Debian 8, Ubuntu 15.04, CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Fedora 15, and replaces legacy init systems including SysVinit and Upstart while remaining backwards compatible with the aforementioned init systems."
Systemd Service,485,Systemd utilizes configuration files known as service units to control how services boot and under what conditions.
Systemd Service,485,"By default, these unit files are stored in the /etc/systemd/system and /usr/lib/systemd/system directories and have the file extension .service."
Systemd Service,485,"Each service unit file may contain numerous directives that can execute system commands:
* ExecStart, ExecStartPre, and ExecStartPost directives cover execution of commands when a services is started manually by 'systemctl' or on system start if the service is set to automatically start."
Systemd Service,485,* ExecReload directive covers when a service restarts.
Systemd Service,485,* ExecStop and ExecStopPost directives cover when a service is stopped or manually by 'systemctl'.
Systemd Service,485,Adversaries have used systemd functionality to establish persistent access to victim systems by creating and/or modifying service unit files that cause systemd to execute malicious commands at system boot.
Systemd Service,485,"While adversaries typically require root privileges to create/modify service unit files in the /etc/systemd/system and /usr/lib/systemd/system directories, low privilege users can create/modify service unit files in directories such as ~/.config/systemd/user/ to achieve user-level persistence."

Systemd Service,485,TeamTNT has established persistence through the creation of a cryptocurrency mining system service.
Systemd Timers,486,Adversaries may abuse systemd timers to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.
Systemd Timers,486,Systemd timers are unit files with file extension .timer that control services.
Systemd Timers,486,Timers can be set to run on a calendar event or after a time span relative to a starting point.
Systemd Timers,486,They can be used as an alternative to Cron in Linux environments.
Systemd Timers,486,"Systemd timers may be activated remotely via the systemctl command line utility, which operates over SSH."
Systemd Timers,486,"Each .timer file must have a corresponding .service file with the same name, e.g., example.timer and example.service."
Systemd Timers,486,.service files are Systemd Service unit files that are managed by the systemd system and service manager.
Systemd Timers,486,Privileged timers are written to /etc/systemd/system/ and /usr/lib/systemd/system while user level are written to ~/.config/systemd/user/.
Systemd Timers,486,An adversary may use systemd timers to execute malicious code at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.
Systemd Timers,486,Timers installed using privileged paths may be used to maintain root level persistence.
Systemd Timers,486,Adversaries may also install user level timers to achieve user level persistence.
TFTP Boot,487,Adversaries may abuse netbooting to load an unauthorized network device operating system from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol  server.
TFTP Boot,487,TFTP boot  is commonly used by network administrators to load configuration-controlled network device images from a centralized management server.
TFTP Boot,487,"Netbooting is one option in the boot sequence and can be used to centralize, manage, and control device images."
TFTP Boot,487,"Adversaries may manipulate the configuration on the network device specifying use of a malicious TFTP server, which may be used in conjunction with Modify System Image to load a modified image on device startup or reset."
TFTP Boot,487,"The unauthorized image allows adversaries to modify device configuration, add malicious capabilities to the device, and introduce backdoors to maintain control of the network device while minimizing detection through use of a standard functionality."
TFTP Boot,487,This technique is similar to ROMMONkit and may result in the network device running a modified image.
Taint Shared Content,488,"Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories."
Taint Shared Content,488,"Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files."
Taint Shared Content,488,"Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system."
Taint Shared Content,488,Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.
Taint Shared Content,488,A directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory.
Taint Shared Content,488,"It uses Shortcut Modification of directory .LNK files that use Masquerading to look like the real directories, which are hidden through Hidden Files and Directories."
Taint Shared Content,488,The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs.
Taint Shared Content,488,"When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts."
Taint Shared Content,488,Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory.
Taint Shared Content,488,The malware may modify the original entry point  of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code.
Taint Shared Content,488,The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system.
Taint Shared Content,488,"These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS."
Taint Shared Content,488,Miner-C copies itself into the public folder of Network Attached Storage  devices and infects new victims who open the file.
Taint Shared Content,488,H1N1 has functionality to copy itself to network shares.
Taint Shared Content,488,Ursnif has copied itself to and infected files in network drives for propagation.

Taint Shared Content,488,Stuxnet infects remote servers via network shares and by infecting WinCC database views with malicious code.
Taint Shared Content,488,Conti can spread itself by infecting other remote machines via network shared drives.
Taint Shared Content,488,Darkhotel used a virus that propagates by infecting executables stored on shared drives.
Taint Shared Content,488,BRONZE BUTLER has placed malware on file shares and given it the same name as legitimate documents on the share.
Taint Shared Content,488,Gamaredon Group has injected malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents on mapped network drives.
Template Injection,489,Adversaries may create or modify references in Office document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts.
Template Injection,489,Microsoft’s Office Open XML  specification defines an XML-based format for Office documents  to replace older binary formats .
Template Injection,489,"OOXML files are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered."
Template Injection,489,Properties within parts may reference shared public resources accessed via online URLs.
Template Injection,489,"For example, template properties reference a file, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded."
Template Injection,489,Adversaries may abuse this technology to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via documents.
Template Injection,489,Template references injected into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded.
Template Injection,489,These documents can be delivered via other techniques such as Phishing and/or Taint Shared Content and may evade static detections since no typical indicators  are present until after the malicious payload is fetched.
Template Injection,489,Examples have been seen in the wild where template injection was used to load malicious code containing an exploit.
Template Injection,489,This technique may also enable Forced Authentication by injecting a SMB/HTTPS  URL and triggering an authentication attempt.
Template Injection,489,Chaes changed the template target of the settings.xml file embedded in the Word document and populated that field with the downloaded URL of the next payload.
Template Injection,489,Dragonfly 2.0 has injected SMB URLs into malicious Word spearphishing attachments to initiate Forced Authentication.
Template Injection,489,"DarkHydrus used an open-source tool, Phishery, to inject malicious remote template URLs into Microsoft Word documents and then sent them to victims to enable Forced Authentication."
Template Injection,489,"Tropic Trooper delivered malicious documents with the XLSX extension, typically used by OpenXML documents, but the file itself was actually an OLE  document."
Template Injection,489,APT28 used weaponized Microsoft Word documents abusing the remote template function to retrieve a malicious macro.
Template Injection,489,Inception has used decoy documents to load malicious remote payloads via HTTP.
Template Injection,489,Frankenstein has used trojanized documents that retrieve remote templates from an adversary-controlled website.
Template Injection,489,Gamaredon Group has used DOCX files to download malicious DOT document templates.
Template Injection,489,Gamaredon Group can also inject malicious macros or remote templates into documents already present on compromised systems.
Thread Execution Hijacking,490,Adversaries may inject malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
Thread Execution Hijacking,490,Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
Thread Execution Hijacking,490,"Thread Execution Hijacking is commonly performed by suspending an existing process then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code or the path to a DLL."
Thread Execution Hijacking,490,"At this point the process can be suspended then written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via SuspendThread , VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, SetThreadContext, then ResumeThread respectively."
Thread Execution Hijacking,490,This is very similar to Process Hollowing but targets an existing process rather than creating a process in a suspended state.
Thread Execution Hijacking,490,Execution via Thread Execution Hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
Thread Execution Hijacking,490,Gazer performs thread execution hijacking to inject its orchestrator into a running thread from a remote process.
Thread Execution Hijacking,490,Trojan.Karagany can inject a suspended thread of its own process into a new process and initiate via the ResumeThread API.
Thread Execution Hijacking,490,Waterbear can use thread injection to inject shellcode into the process of security software.
Thread Local Storage,491,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via thread local storage  callbacks in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
Thread Local Storage,491,TLS callback injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
Thread Local Storage,491,TLS callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable  to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point.
Thread Local Storage,491,TLS callbacks are normally used by the OS to setup and/or cleanup data used by threads.
Thread Local Storage,491,Manipulating TLS callbacks may be performed by allocating and writing to specific offsets within a process’ memory space using other Process Injection techniques such as Process Hollowing.
Thread Local Storage,491,Execution via TLS callback injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
Thread Local Storage,491,Ursnif has injected code into target processes via thread local storage callbacks.
Threat Intel Vendors,492,Adversaries may search private data from threat intelligence vendors for information that can be used during targeting.
Threat Intel Vendors,492,Threat intelligence vendors may offer paid feeds or portals that offer more data than what is publicly reported.
Threat Intel Vendors,492,"Although sensitive details  may be redacted, this information may contain trends regarding breaches such as target industries, attribution claims, and successful TTPs/countermeasures."

Traffic Duplication,498,Adversaries may abuse traffic mirroring to mirror or redirect network traffic through other network infrastructure they control.
Traffic Duplication,498,Malicious modifications to network devices to enable traffic redirection may be possible through ROMMONkit or Patch System Image.
Traffic Duplication,498,"Adversaries may use traffic duplication in conjunction with Network Sniffing, Input Capture, or Adversary-in-the-Middle depending on the goals and objectives of the adversary."
Traffic Signaling,499,Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control.
Traffic Signaling,499,"Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task."
Traffic Signaling,499,This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control.
Traffic Signaling,499,"Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports  Port Knocking, but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics."
Traffic Signaling,499,"After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software."
Traffic Signaling,499,"Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value."
Traffic Signaling,499,"On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable Network Device Authentication for standard services offered by the device such as telnet."
Traffic Signaling,499,"Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities."
Traffic Signaling,499,"To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage Patch System Image due to the monolithic nature of the architecture."
Traffic Signaling,499,Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems.
Traffic Signaling,499,"Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it."
Traffic Signaling,499,"Once the system is powered on, it may become a target for lateral movement."

Transfer Data to Cloud Account,500,"Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including backups of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service to avoid typical file transfers/downloads and network-based exfiltration detection."
Transfer Data to Cloud Account,500,A defender who is monitoring for large transfers to outside the cloud environment through normal file transfers or over command and control channels may not be watching for data transfers to another account within the same cloud provider.
Transfer Data to Cloud Account,500,Such transfers may utilize existing cloud provider APIs and the internal address space of the cloud provider to blend into normal traffic or avoid data transfers over external network interfaces.
Transfer Data to Cloud Account,500,Incidents have been observed where adversaries have created backups of cloud instances and transferred them to separate accounts.
Transmitted Data Manipulation,501,Adversaries may alter data en route to storage or other systems in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity.
Transmitted Data Manipulation,501,"By manipulating transmitted data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making."
Transmitted Data Manipulation,501,Manipulation may be possible over a network connection or between system processes where there is an opportunity deploy a tool that will intercept and change information.
Transmitted Data Manipulation,501,The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target transmission mechanism as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary.
Transmitted Data Manipulation,501,"LightNeuron is capable of modifying email content, headers, and attachments during transit."

Transport Agent,502,"Microsoft Exchange transport agents can operate on email messages passing through the transport pipeline to perform various tasks such as filtering spam, filtering malicious attachments, journaling, or adding a corporate signature to the end of all outgoing emails."
Transport Agent,502,Transport agents can be written by application developers and then compiled to .NET assemblies that are subsequently registered with the Exchange server.
Transport Agent,502,Transport agents will be invoked during a specified stage of email processing and carry out developer defined tasks.
Transport Agent,502,Adversaries may register a malicious transport agent to provide a persistence mechanism in Exchange Server that can be triggered by adversary-specified email events.
Transport Agent,502,"Though a malicious transport agent may be invoked for all emails passing through the Exchange transport pipeline, the agent can be configured to only carry out specific tasks in response to adversary defined criteria."
Transport Agent,502,"For example, the transport agent may only carry out an action like copying in-transit attachments and saving them for later exfiltration if the recipient email address matches an entry on a list provided by the adversary."
Transport Agent,502,LightNeuron has used a malicious Microsoft Exchange transport agent for persistence.
Trap,503,Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal.
Trap,503,The trap command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals.
Trap,503,A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like ctrl+c and ctrl+d.
Trap,503,Adversaries can use this to register code to be executed when the shell encounters specific interrupts as a persistence mechanism.
Trap,503,"Trap commands are of the following format trap 'command list' signals where ""command list"" will be executed when ""signals"" are received."
Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution,504,Adversaries may take advantage of trusted developer utilities to proxy execution of malicious payloads.
Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution,504,"There are many utilities used for software development related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development, debugging, and reverse engineering."
Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution,504,These utilities may often be signed with legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application control solutions.
Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution,504,"A version of PlugX loads as shellcode within a .NET Framework project using msbuild.exe, presumably to bypass application whitelisting techniques."
Trusted Relationship,505,Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims.
Trusted Relationship,505,Access through trusted third party relationship exploits an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.
Trusted Relationship,505,Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments.
Trusted Relationship,505,"Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors ."
Trusted Relationship,505,"The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise."
Trusted Relationship,505,"As such, Valid Accounts used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used."
Trusted Relationship,505,menuPass has used legitimate access granted to Managed Service Providers in order to access victims of interest.

Two-Factor Authentication Interception,506,"Adversaries may target two-factor authentication mechanisms, such as smart cards, to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources."
Two-Factor Authentication Interception,506,"Use of two or multi-factor authentication  is recommended and provides a higher level of security than user names and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms."
Two-Factor Authentication Interception,506,"If a smart card is used for two-factor authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use."
Two-Factor Authentication Interception,506,"With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token."
Two-Factor Authentication Interception,506,"Adversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID."
Two-Factor Authentication Interception,506,Capturing token input  may provide temporary access  replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values .
Two-Factor Authentication Interception,506,Other methods of 2FA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate.
Two-Factor Authentication Interception,506,It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications .
Two-Factor Authentication Interception,506,"If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception."
Two-Factor Authentication Interception,506,"Although primarily focused on by cyber criminals, these authentication mechanisms have been targeted by advanced actors."

Unix Shell,507,Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution.
Unix Shell,507,"Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems, though many variations of the Unix shell exist  depending on the specific OS or distribution."
Unix Shell,507,"Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges."
Unix Shell,507,Unix shells also support scripts that enable sequential execution of commands as well as other typical programming operations such as conditionals and loops.
Unix Shell,507,"Common uses of shell scripts include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems."
Unix Shell,507,Adversaries may abuse Unix shells to execute various commands or payloads.

Use Alternate Authentication Material,513,Authentication processes generally require a valid identity  along with one or more authentication factors .
Use Alternate Authentication Material,513,Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor.
Use Alternate Authentication Material,513,Alternate authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation process.
Use Alternate Authentication Material,513,Caching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor.
Use Alternate Authentication Material,513,Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen through Credential Access techniques.
Use Alternate Authentication Material,513,"By stealing alternate authentication material, adversaries are able to bypass system access controls and authenticate to systems without knowing the plaintext password or any additional authentication factors."

User Activity Based Checks,514,Darkhotel has used malware that repeatedly checks the mouse cursor position to determine if a real user is on the system.
User Execution,515,An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution.
User Execution,515,"Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link."
User Execution,515,These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of Phishing.
User Execution,515,"While User Execution frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it."

VBA Stomping,516,Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications  payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data.
VBA Stomping,516,MS Office documents with embedded VBA content store source code inside of module streams.
VBA Stomping,516,Each module stream has a PerformanceCache that stores a separate compiled version of the VBA source code known as p-code.
VBA Stomping,516,The p-code is executed when the MS Office version specified in the _VBA_PROJECT stream  matches the version of the host MS Office application.
VBA Stomping,516,"An adversary may hide malicious VBA code by overwriting the VBA source code location with zero’s, benign code, or random bytes while leaving the previously compiled malicious p-code."
VBA Stomping,516,Tools that scan for malicious VBA source code may be bypassed as the unwanted code is hidden in the compiled p-code.
VBA Stomping,516,"If the VBA source code is removed, some tools might even think that there are no macros present."
VBA Stomping,516,"If there is a version match between the _VBA_PROJECT stream and host MS Office application, the p-code will be executed, otherwise the benign VBA source code will be decompressed and recompiled to p-code, thus removing malicious p-code and potentially bypassing dynamic analysis."
VDSO Hijacking,517,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via VDSO hijacking in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
VDSO Hijacking,517,Virtual dynamic shared object  hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
VDSO Hijacking,517,VDSO hijacking involves redirecting calls to dynamically linked shared libraries.
VDSO Hijacking,517,Memory protections may prevent writing executable code to a process via Ptrace System Calls.
VDSO Hijacking,517,"However, an adversary may hijack the syscall interface code stubs mapped into a process from the vdso shared object to execute syscalls to open and map a malicious shared object."
VDSO Hijacking,517,This code can then be invoked by redirecting the execution flow of the process via patched memory address references stored in a process' global offset table .
VDSO Hijacking,517,Execution via VDSO hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
VNC,518,Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing .
VNC,518,"VNC is a platform-independent desktop sharing system that uses the RFB  protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer’s display by relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network."
